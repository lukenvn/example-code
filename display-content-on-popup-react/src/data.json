Also thank you for listening to <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ask-a-clean-person/id996183661\">my weird little cleaning show</a>!<br></p><p>It&#x2019;s been a minute since I&#x2019;ve covered mattress care and stain removal, so that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to do today. I&#x2019;ve got help for our LW&#x2019;s very specific situation, as well as tips for the rest of you who may be experiencing some adjacent and very common issues with your mattresses. Let&#x2019;s do this thing.</p><h4><strong>All-Over Stain Removal</strong></h4><p>When it comes to doing a large-scale cleaning of a mattress, the best option is going to be to use a carpet and upholstery cleaning machine for the job. These machines work by forcing a cleaning solution into the fibers and then extracting it back out, which is crucial to not ending up with a sopping wet mattress that will likely then develop mold and mildew.</p><p>You can rent this type of machine for about $30 at grocery, hardware or home improvement stores, or you can buy one. They come in three primary styles: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BISSELL-Powerbrush-Steamer-Cleaner-16237/dp/B071YHZN56?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=dedd1c3e04cf8b2a83efa3f4f4d73bae6c671130\">Upright</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bissell-3624-SpotClean-Professional-Portable/dp/B008DBRFBK?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=06949b50bca86147ee911b5c069f79cad63b2dc5\">portable corded</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BISSELL-2003T-Cordless-Portable-Cleaner/dp/B07FFJB75H?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=1c36ae6c797a83d801d20184f45882c6e9217902\">handheld</a>.

But that <em>is</em> a very good technique to use to remove smaller stains from a mattress. The process she described &#x2014; using a damp, light-colored cloth and a stain treatment product to tamp at the stains until they begin to lift &#x2014; allows you to control the amount of liquid you&#x2019;re introducing the to the mattress, and use the cloth to create some friction that will help to break up the staining.</p><p>The thing that LW got wrong, however, is her choice of stain removers: Shout is the stuff for food stains, but it&#x2019;s not great on protein stains like sweat, blood or sexual fluids.

Vacuuming a mattress will, perhaps surprisingly, make a pretty significant difference when it comes to odor management. Your regular vacuum is just fine for this operation, just switch to the upholstery and crevice attachments that come standard with most models. If you want to level up, sprinkle the mattress with a liberal amount <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Baking-Soda-Lbs/dp/B073H1NJKK?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=d6abc63ae488d4f089ee3f023a87d5b471f1e68a\">baking soda</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Strength-Carpet-Cleaners/dp/B07CTZ3N9C?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=3182474c08e3f71308a5b7349ec72c2777f0c3ce\">a carpet odor-eliminating powder</a>, which can also be used on mattresses or upholstered furniture. Let the powder sit for at least 30 minutes, then vacuum it up. If allergen management is a consideration for you, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-V6-Mattress-Handheld-Vacuum/dp/B010FQ4STC?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=a18122a3f2c2a792c7e0e8dbc2e41c2e112080f0\">Dyson Mattress Vacuum</a>, which is much more powerful than standard vacuums and therefore can pull dander and dust from deep within a mattress&#x2019;s fibers, is a purchase well worth considering.</p><aside class=\"core-decorated-commerce js_inset\"><div class=\"commerce-inset commerce-inset--condensed\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Strength-Carpet-Cleaners/dp/B07CTZ3N9C?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=69fb0e8896ca3308b76ed4463b9ac45715dbb47b\" class=\"commerce-inset__badge commerce-inset__badge--absolute\">$20</a><div class=\"commerce-inset__image\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Strength-Carpet-Cleaners/dp/B07CTZ3N9C?tag=theinventory-20&amp;ascsubtag=69fb0e8896ca3308b76ed4463b9ac45715dbb47b\"><img src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--lYR4Klrp--/c_fit,fl_progressive,h_166,q_80,w_295/bwk9cjfbmt3dynnokotd.jpg\"></a></div><div class=\"commerce-inset__content-wrapper commerce-inset__content-wrapper--centered-on-mobile\"><header class=\"commerce-inset__title commerce-inset__title--responsive\"></header><div class=\"commerce-inset__misc\"><span class=\"commerce-inset__social-proof\">1 bought by readers</span><span class=\"commerce-inset__disclosure\">GMG may get a commission</span></div></div></div></aside></div>",
